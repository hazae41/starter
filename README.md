# Starter

Start a cool webapp with React and Tailwind

## Features

- Built on web standards and fundamentals
- Works with any client-side and/or static-side library (e.g. React, jQuery)
- Focused on security and simplicity without degrading performances
- Supply-chain hardened with the bare minimum dependencies
- Built for Deno but backward compatible with Node/Bun
- Deploy it anywhere HTML/CSS/JS files can be stored
- Builds are cross-platform cross-runtime reproducible
- Immutably cached with a 1-year cached service worker

## Stack

- `deno` for the runtime
- `react` and `react-dom` for rendering
- `tailwindcss` via `@hazae41/rewind` for the styles
- `esbuild` via `@hazae41/glace` for bundling
- `@hazae41/immutable` for immutable caching
